Usually, when a person is tagged, the tagger says, `Tag, you're 'it'!` The last one tagged during tag is `it` for the next round.",

      "FAKE: Slapjack, also known as Slaps, is a card game of the matching family, generally played among children. The first player to slap their hand down on the jack takes it, as well as all the cards beneath it. The player winning these cards turns them face down, places them under their pile of cards, and shuffles them to form a new, larger pile. When more than one player slaps at a jack, the one whose hand is directly on top of the jack wins the pile. If a player slaps at any card in the center that is not a jack, they must give one card, face down, to the player of that card. When a player has no more cards left, they remain in the game until the next jack is turned. The player may slap at the jack in an effort to get a new pile. If the player fails to win that next pile, they are out of the game.",
